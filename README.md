 Hey!! there ðŸ‘‹ <br> <br>
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Francisco Sanchez, and I am currently pursuing a degree in software development at the Universidad Tecnologica de Nezahualcoyotl. ðŸŽ“ My primary area of expertise lies in web development, but my true passion lies in the field of data science. ðŸŒŸ I consider myself a self-taught individual, as I have honed most of my skills through dedicated courses and hands-on practice. ðŸ’» My determination to excel in data science drives me to continually learn and grow in this ever-evolving field. ðŸ“ˆðŸ“Š

Do you want to know more about me. [Check my portfolio]() (in development).
