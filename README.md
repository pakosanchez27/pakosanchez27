 Hey!! there ðŸ‘‹ <br> <br>
I'm Paco Sanchez. I am a software development student at the Universidad Tecnologica de Nezahualcoyotl.
I have knowledge in the area of web development. although my goal is to specialize in the area of data science.
I consider myself a self-taught person since most of my skills have been obtained from courses and my own practices

Do you want to know more about me. [Check my portfolio]() (in development).
